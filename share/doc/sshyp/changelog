sshyp v1.2.0

the brisk bahh update

this release focuses on speeding up the sshyp user experience by adding
new features that reduce wasted time

compatibility-breaking changes:

- new configuration options (quick-unlock, offline mode) have been added and
the configuration files have been reorganized
    ^ simply running "sshyp tweak" and following the setup wizard will correct any compatibility
    issues
- for quick-unlock security, device names have been replaced with more secure device ids
    ^ older device names are still compatible, but for security reasons it is recommended
    to delete any pre-existing device names from the server and allow "sshyp tweak" to re-register
    your devices

user-facing features:

- quick-unlock mode has been added
    ^ this allows you to use a shortened version of your password by verifying that your device
    is whitelisted on your sshyp server - it's both faster and more secure than standard unlock,
    but it requires an active connection to your sshyp server to authenticate (otherwise it will
    fall back to standard unlock)
- full support for offline usage
    ^ though sshyp could be used without a server before, it now can be configured to not attempt
    to find one ever - this saves time and hides sync failure error messages
- bash completions have been added
    ^ if you have bash-completion installed, you can now use the tab key in bash to auto-complete
    sshyp arguments and entry names (client only, not added for server-specific arguments)
        ^ if you do not have bash-completion installed, you can source
        /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/sshyp (Linux/BSD) or
        /boot/system/data/bash-completion/completions/sshyp (Haiku) in your ~/.bashrc to
        use this feature

fixes/optimizations:

- fixed entries with multi-word titles failing to decrypt
- password generation is now much faster and more resource efficient
- there is no longer a length limit on generated passwords
- improved visual consistency of help menus
- rarely used modules are now imported only when needed
- sshyp now uses one fewer configuration file

other notable changes:

- sshyp is now specifically licensed under the GPL-3.0-only (keyword: only)
- sshyp now has some possible arguments and its own help menu when running in server mode
- temporary files in /dev/shm are now generated with more complex names
- sshyp now installs in /usr/lib/sshyp (Linux/BSD) or /system/lib/sshyp (Haiku) instead of
/usr/bin or /bin (it is still symlinked to the old directories)
