sshyp v1.1.0

the sheecrets update

the main focus of this release was adding extension support (particularly for sshyp-mfa)
and cleaning up the configuration experience

compatibility-breaking changes:

- the entry directory has been moved from ~/.password-pasture to ~/.local/share/sshyp
as a means of complying with the XDG base directory spec
    ^ this requires the user to move their entry directory to the new location manually
        ^ if this is not done, sshyp will not be able to find entries made prior to v1.1.0
- due to a new configuration option (preferred text editor), 'sshyp tweak' must be run after updating

user-facing features:

- extension support
    ^ some of sshyp's critical functions can now be imported into other programs to extend
    upon sshyp's functionality
        ^ the first usecase of this is sshyp-mfa, which can be found at https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs
- a new configuration experience
    ^ the 'sshyp tweak' menu has been made much more readable, and now the automatically generated
    gpg key has its id automatically input, making the process easier for the user
- customizable text editor
    ^ the text editor used for editing notes can now be set to any editor preferred by the user
        ^ this means that nano was dropped as a dependency

fixes:

- to avoid exceptions on server devices, all arguments (apart from 'tweak') have been disabled on servers
- fixed entry readout not printing blank lines between fields under certain conditions
- various optimizations
