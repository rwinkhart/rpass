sshyp v1.1.1

the sheecrets update - patch one

this is a polish/bug fix release that makes tweaks to the entry format (without breaking compatibility)

compatibility-breaking changes:

- none; the entry format tweaks are backward compatible with sshyp v1.0.0+
    ^ the new format is slightly more efficient in terms of storage space
        ^ if you would like to upgrade to it, run this script (after updating to v1.1.1):
          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs/main/extra/conversion-scripts/sshyp-refresh-1.1.1%2B.py

user-facing features:

- entries (when editing or adding) are now run through the new optimized_edit() function to strip trailing new lines
and ensure the format of the entries is fully compatible with all of sshyp's functions

fixes:

- when adding a note to an entry, there is no longer a chance the first note line will be added as a url
if the entry is using an older format/pass format
- the gpg auto-generation file temporarily created by sshyp no longer includes extra spaces
    ^ seems to serve no functional purpose - fixed for the sake of polish
