sshyp v1.4.3
06/08/2023

the argumentative agronomist update - patch three

IMPORTANT: the next major release of sshyp, v1.5.0, will make breaking changes that will require
running through 'sshyp tweak' again - also starting with v1.5.0, a copy of the changelog will no
longer be packaged with sshyp (it will still be available on GitHub) and clipboard tools
(x-clip and wl-clipboard) will be set to optional dependencies ('sshyp tweak' will warn of this)

this is a highly unconventional release featuring backports to fix critical bugs found during the
development of the upcoming v1.5.0

fixes:

- folder renaming has been disabled to prevent a severe data loss bug from occuring
    ^ this has been properly fixed for v1.5.0, but the fix requires all clients and servers
    to be updated - to avoid breaking compatibility with 1.4.X, folder renaming was simply disabled
    for the time being
- backported fix for syncing over IPv6
- backported fix for multiple versions of Powershell being called under WSL
