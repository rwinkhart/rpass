sshyp v1.1.2

the sheecrets update - patch two

this is a general polish/bugfix release

user-facing features:

- packaging support for Alpine Linux/postmarketOS
- the rename() function is no longer unnecessarily verbose
- handled exception for when the user attempts to copy an entry field that does not exist

fixes/optimizations:

- replaced shebang with "#!/usr/bin/env python3" for improved compatibility with various systems
    ^ does not affect Haiku packaging
- fixed the generic package not actually being compressed
- reduced lines of code used for cross-device entry deletion

sshyp v1.1.1

the sheecrets update - patch one

this is a polish/bug fix release that makes tweaks to the entry format (without breaking compatibility)

compatibility-breaking changes:

- none; the entry format tweaks are backward compatible with sshyp v1.0.0+
    ^ the new format is slightly more efficient in terms of storage space
        ^ if you would like to upgrade to it, run this script (after updating to v1.1.1):
          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs/main/extra/conversion-scripts/sshyp-refresh-1.1.1%2B.py

user-facing features:

- entries (when editing or adding) are now run through the new optimized_edit() function to strip trailing new lines
and ensure the format of the entries is fully compatible with all of sshyp's functions

fixes:

- when adding a note to an entry, there is no longer a chance the first note line will be added as a url
if the entry is using an older format/pass format
- the gpg auto-generation file temporarily created by sshyp no longer includes extra spaces
    ^ seems to serve no functional purpose - fixed for the sake of polish

sshyp v1.1.0

the sheecrets update

the main focus of this release was adding extension support (particularly for sshyp-mfa)
and cleaning up the configuration experience

compatibility-breaking changes:

- the entry directory has been moved from ~/.password-pasture to ~/.local/share/sshyp
as a means of complying with the XDG base directory spec
    ^ this requires the user to move their entry directory to the new location manually
        ^ if this is not done, sshyp will not be able to find entries made prior to v1.1.0
- due to a new configuration option (preferred text editor), 'sshyp tweak' must be run after updating

user-facing features:

- extension support
    ^ some of sshyp's critical functions can now be imported into other programs to extend
    upon sshyp's functionality
        ^ the first usecase of this is sshyp-mfa, which can be found at https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs
- a new configuration experience
    ^ the 'sshyp tweak' menu has been made much more readable, and now the automatically generated
    gpg key has its id automatically input, making the process easier for the user
- customizable text editor
    ^ the text editor used for editing notes can now be set to any editor preferred by the user
        ^ this means that nano was dropped as a dependency

fixes:

- to avoid exceptions on server devices, all arguments (apart from 'tweak') have been disabled on servers
- fixed entry readout not printing blank lines between fields under certain conditions
- various optimizations

sshyp v1.0.1

The Polished Trotters Update - Patch 1

This is a hotfix for the Haiku decryption bug.

Changes:

- subprocess.Popen has been replaced with subprocess.run where applicable
- stdout is no longer captured with any subprocess.Popen or subprocess.run usages
    ^ this fixes decryption on Haiku

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

sshyp v1.0.0

The Polished Trotters Update

This release brings 'sshyp' in line with the original goals of the project.
As such, it is being crowned "v1.0.0", and is considered a stable base for future expansions.

Features:

- sshyp has been modified to run on Haiku, an open-source re-implementation of BeOS
    ^ new package formats have been added for Haiku, FreeBSD, and Fedora Linux
- the entry format has been changed to support entries created in pass/password-store
    ^ this change requires existing entry libraries to be converted - see the sshyp v1.0.0 release page on GitHub for a conversion script
- majorly overhauled visual experience for sshyp
    ^ this includes a new entry list, a new entry readout, colored output, ascii art, and more!
- entries can now optionally be passed as arguments, directly
    ^ as opposed to the user being prompted for an entry name after running a command

Changes:

- corrected outdated licensing and copyright information
- 'if __name__=="__main__":' convention is now used
- help screens have been overhauled
- improved password generator to guarantee more secure results
- fixed errors when trying to sync with a multi-word entry on the server
- sshync now uses 'scp' (via the sftp protocol), rather than 'sftp'
- rename function now properly allows for renaming folders
- renaming an entry/folder will now properly delete the old entry/folder from the server
- entry previews at the time of entry creation/editing no longer require entering the gpg password more times than necessary
- entries will no longer be overwritten if attempting to create a new entry that uses an already existing name
- the clipboard now automatically clears after 30 seconds
- sshyp server no longer needs to create copies of its libraries in ~/
- added more and improved existing exceptions
- the lock file is now decrypted to /dev/null
- ...and lots of minor (under the hood) changes!

sshyp 2022.02.16.fr4

The High-Tech Shears Update

This release adds in a major feature: multi-client deletion (details below)

Note: This release requires the configuration ("sshyp tweak") to be re-done, as a device name now must be set (for multi-client deletion).

Features:

    ^ the current implementation requires a new Python script in addition to sshyp and sshync

Changes:

- fixed an issue where sshyp would use the wrong SSH key when trying to delete entries from or create folders on the server
    ^ this is a fix that was recently applied to sshync - turns out I made the same mistake in sshyp
- deleting folders should now work properly with "sshyp shear" if the directory is entered with a following "/"

This release fixes major bugs from rpass and rebrands the project.

New features:

- an entirely new syncing back-end called sshync (custom Python wrapper around sftp)

rpass 2021.11.01.mr5.1

The Notetaker Update - Patch 1

This is the FINAL release of "rpass".
After this release, the project will be rebranded as "sshyp".

rpass's syncing system is fundamentally broken, hence the need for "sshyp"
and its new syncing system. I would highly advise against using this release.

New features:

- none

Changes:

- fixed an issue with copying notes (currently only copies first line, will be changed in the future)
- rpass is validated to work with Python 3.10 (no changes were needed)

Planned for next update (sshyp fr1)

- full project rebrand ("sshyp")
- new syncing back-end

Changes:

- fixed issues with copying passwords with certain special characters, e.g. '"()|
- auto-generated ssh key now uses ed25519, rather than rsa-3072
- entry format modified to include a blank line before the notes field (old format still mostly compatible)
- rpass is now much better at catching bad arguments
- some general code cleanup

Planned for next update (The Housekeeping Update Pt. 2):

- add new file list w/color and w/o extensions + proper displaying of nested folders
- ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions
- manpage
- add more comments to code
- validate for Python 3.10

Planned for next update (The cryptpass Update):

- initial implementation of a data store for other applications (libsecret alt.)

    ^ the gui will also function on desktop linux
- make platform agnostic (add Windows support and package for more Linux distributions, such as Alpine and Debian)
- auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)
