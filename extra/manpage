.SH NAME
sshyp \- A very simple self-hosted, synchronized password manager for UNIX(-like) systems. Alternative to (and compatible with) pass/password-store.
.SH SYNOPSIS
sshyp [OPTION] [[FLAG]] [/<entry name>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
sshyp is a lightweight password and note management program written in Python. sshyp is used via CLI and is self-hosted with a client-server model. sshyp expects that you have access to a personal server with a properly configured ssh server, ideally accepting remote connections.
.SH EXAMPLES
Setting up sshyp for the first time or altering its configuration (also recommended after major updates):
    sshyp tweak

Viewing the entry database:
    sshyp

Reading an existing entry saved as ~/.local/share/sshyp/development/github.gpg:
    sshyp /development/github

Copying the password of an existing entry saved as ~/.local/share/sshyp/financial/bank.gpg:
    sshyp copy -p /financial/bank

Editing the username of an existing entry saved as ~/.local/share/sshyp/game.gpg:
    sshyp edit -u game

Making a new entry saved as ~/.local/share/sshyp/school/university.gpg using the built-in password generator:
    sshyp gen /school/university

Creating a note-only entry saved as ~/.local/share/sshyp/notes/testNote.gpg:
    sshyp add -n /notes/testNote

Manually syncing entries with the server:
    sshyp sync

Removing an existing folder saved as ~/.local/share/sshyp/social:
    sshyp shear social/

.SH SETUP
sshyp operates on a client-server model, and thus requires you to have access to your own server (whether it be a physical home server or a cloud rental) with remote access via SSH.

The sshyp package includes modes for operating on both client and server devices, so only one package is necessary.

Server setup:
    Configure an OpenSSH server (if sshyp was installed from the Debian package, the ssh server was not installed as a dependency and needs to be installed manually)
    Allow remote access to the SSH server w/public key authentication (disabling password-only authentication recommended)
    Install sshyp
    Run "sshyp tweak" and set the device type as server
    Done!

Client setup:
    Install sshyp
    Run "sshyp tweak" and follow the prompts
    Copy the generated public SSH key (located at ~/.ssh/sshyp.pub) to the server using preferred method (manually adding to authorized_keys, ssh-copy-id, etc.)
    If you already have entries on the server, sync them using "sshyp sync"
    Done!

Please note that the server setup intentionally does not allow the reading of entries (it does not allow adding a gpg decryption key). For security purposes, only clients can read entries.
